# A Vigenere Cipher
## Implemented in Haskell
### What is a Vigenere Cipher?
From Wiki:  The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. It is a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. ... Though the cipher is easy to understand and implement, for three centuries it resisted all attempts to break it; this earned it the description le chiffre indéchiffrable (French for 'the indecipherable cipher').

### How do I use it?
	* To encode:  vigenere "key" "the text you want to encode"
	* to decode:  unVigenere "key" "Sd\DC1_di_\USjZt\DC1b`__\USeZ\USVYb`Od"
